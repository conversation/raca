* region argument to Account#public_endpoint should be optional. Raise
  an error if the requested service requires a region. Choose the global
  endpoint if the requested service has no regions.

* consider adding a servicenet option to the Raca::Account constructor. It
  would default to false. If true, then all service endpoints returned would
  be for the private rackspace servicenet. Maybe also rename
  Raca::Account#public_endpoint to just endpoint. It can return public and servicenet
  endpoints based on the setting.

* reduce duplication in logging

* Consider adding more response details to our HTTPError classes. Status code, etc

* Is it possible to created signed URLs for uploading files? Could be a nifty way
  to allow users to upload images directly from the browser

* remove complicated timeout handling. It was a misguided attempt to fix our
  "408 timeout" issue
