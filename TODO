* region argument to Account#public_endpoint should be optional. Raise
  an error if the requested service requires a region. Choose the global endpoiint if the to requested service has no regions.

* Same for Account#servicenet_endpoint

* reduce duplication in http request code

* reduce duplication in logging

* create custom exceptions for HTTP issues: 400, 404, 500, everything else. We
  currently raise a RuntimeError and that's useless to our users. Should reference
  the underlying issue (maybe the full response object) in case the caller needs
  to debug
